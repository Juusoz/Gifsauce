# Gifsauce
This is a simple Python program that lets you convert sections of video files into gifs locally.<br><br>
I got tired of online gif converters not allowing me to upload a full length, 4 gigabyte movie onto their servers so I could make a 5 second gif out of them, so I made my own gif converter!
<br>
<br>
<b>Features!</b>
<ul>
 <li>Start and end time trimming</li>
 <li>Resolution adjustment</li>
 <li>Framerate adjustment</li>
 <li>Color palette size adjustment</li>
</ul>
<b>And most importantly of all:</b>
<ul>
 <li>No file size limit!</li>
 <li>No duration limit!</li>
 <li>No upload times or sitting in queues!</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to convert the entire Bee Movie into a gif? Because you can! That is the power of doing things locally!</p>
I am planning on adding plenty more features to this over time, because I kinda got addicted to making gifs.</p>
